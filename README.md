# Mark Luschen's Engineering Portfolio 2025

I'm Mark Luschen, a mechanical engineering student passionate about designing and building mechanical systems that solve real-world problems. I enjoy combining CAD design, prototyping, and hands-on fabrication to bring ideas from concept to reality. My projects range from precision mechanisms like clock escapements to functional assemblies like differentials, showcasing both creativity and engineering rigor.

Mechanical Clock Escapement

Description:
Designed and 3D-printed a mechanical clock escapement mechanism using SolidWorks. This project demonstrates precision gear interaction, motion control, and iterative prototyping. While still a work in progress, it highlights my ability to design functional mechanical assemblies and bring CAD models to life.

Tools / Skills Used:

SolidWorks (3D modeling, assembly)

Engineering drawings and dimensioning

3D printing and prototype fabrication

Motion analysis and mechanism testing

Engineering Highlights / Key Learnings:

Designed interlocking gears and escapement components to achieve controlled motion.

Produced detailed engineering drawings to guide assembly and fabrication.

Iterated the design based on prototype testing, refining tolerances and gear engagement.

Created a short video demonstrating partial operation of the mechanism, showing proof of concept.
